        <div class="subheading mb-5">English Major  ðŸ“–</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Lizbeth Vega. I am in my third year of undergraduate school at University of California, Riverside. I am currently studying english literature in hopes to be a highschool english teacher. I will be applying for graduate school in the fall for a teaching credential and masters. As of right now, I work at an elementary school and tutor students who are struggling in their studies. I have loved working with the students, but I do not see myself teaching multiple subjects a day. Ever since I was young, I have always wanted to be a teacher, I just never knew what subject or grade I wanted to teach. When I graduated high school, I attended community college and took a lot of classes, but I still had no idea what I wanted to teach. Finally, during my third year I took a world literature class and my life was changed forever. I knew what I wanted to major in and teach. After four years at a community college, I finally transferred to UCR. I currently hold a 4.0 GPA and I am expected to finish in less than two years. Going from having no sense of purpose or direction, to knowing exactly what I wanted to do took a long time. I am so thankful for my english professor at my community college, but I wish I had met her sooner. The reason I am pursuing the career of a high school english teacher is because I want to be an inspiration to students who have no idea what they are going to do after highschool. Those students who might feel lost or scared about life after high school. Those students who are going to community college and might be feeling embarrassed; I was in the same boat. I want to make sure these students know that anything is possible. Now, besides school and tutoring, I am also a lifeguard and a student employee at UCRâ€™s transportation services; TAPS. It sounds like a lot of stuff on my plate, but it is nothing I can't handle. I started working at TAPS when I started at UCR and it was just too pick up some more hours on top of the tutoring. I ended up loving the job, the people, and the experience. I ended up staying. During the school year I split my time between the two jobs. Since tutoring and TAPS are only nine months out the year, I work as a lifeguard over summer. It is such a fun job, it does not even feel like work. When a pool is managed correctly, there are less accidents so recreation swim is an easy shift. I also teach swim lessons and it is so much fun working with the kids and teaching them such important skills. It might seem as if I do not have time for anything when having three jobs and going to school, but I always find time for myself. I love spending time with family, reading, and riding my bike.   <br><br>
